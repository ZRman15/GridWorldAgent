# AI Module Assignment: Grid World Agent

## Description

This assignment for my Artificial Intelligence module involves developing an agent to navigate a grid world. The agent is programmed to move north, south, east, or west based on predefined conditions, with a reward system in place to guide its behavior. The goal is to explore how agents interact with their environment under specific constraints.

## Implementation Details

- **Language:** Python
- **Library Used:** `random` for generating random values dictating the agent's movement.

## How to Run

1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Run the script using a Python terminal or any Python IDE.
